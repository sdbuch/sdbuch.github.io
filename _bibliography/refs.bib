  abstract = {Data with low-dimensional nonlinear structure are ubiquitous in engineering and scientific problems. We study a model problem with such structure: a binary classification task that uses a deep fully-connected neural network to classify data drawn from two disjoint smooth curves on the unit sphere. Aside from mild regularity conditions, we place no restrictions on the configuration of the curves. We prove that when (i) the network depth is large relative to certain geometric properties that set the difficulty of the problem and (ii) the network width and number of samples are polynomial in the depth, randomly-initialized gradient descent quickly learns to correctly classify all points on the two curves with high probability. To our knowledge, this is the first generalization guarantee for deep networks with nonlinear data that depends only on intrinsic data properties. Our analysis proceeds by a reduction to dynamics in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, where the network depth plays the role of a fitting resource in solving the classification problem. In particular, via fine-grained control of the decay properties of the NTK, we demonstrate that when the network is sufficiently deep, the NTK can be locally approximated by a translationally invariant operator on the manifolds and stably inverted over smooth functions, which guarantees convergence and generalization.},

  abstract  = {We study the multiple manifold problem, a binary classification task modeled on applications in machine vision, in which a deep fully-connected neural network is trained to separate two low-dimensional submanifolds of the unit sphere. We provide an analysis of the one-dimensional case, proving for a simple manifold configuration that when the network depth \( L \) is large relative to certain geometric and statistical properties of the data, the network width \(n\) grows as a sufficiently large polynomial in \(L\), and the number of i.i.d. samples from the manifolds is polynomial in \(L\), randomly-initialized gradient descent rapidly learns to classify the two manifolds perfectly with high probability. Our analysis demonstrates concrete benefits of depth and width in the context of a practically-motivated model problem: the depth acts as a fitting resource, with larger depths corresponding to smoother networks that can more readily separate the class manifolds, and the width acts as a statistical resource, enabling concentration of the randomly-initialized network and its gradients. The argument centers around the "neural tangent kernel" of Jacot et al. and its role in the nonasymptotic analysis of training overparameterized neural networks; to this literature, we contribute essentially optimal rates of concentration for the neural tangent kernel of deep fully-connected ReLU networks, requiring width \(n \geq L\,\mathrm\{poly\}(d_0)\) to achieve uniform concentration of the initial kernel over a \(d_0\)-dimensional submanifold of the unit sphere \(\mathbb\{S\}^\{n_0-1\}\), and a nonasymptotic framework for establishing generalization of networks trained in the "NTK regime" with structured data. The proof makes heavy use of martingale concentration to optimally treat statistical dependencies across layers of the initial random network. This approach should be of use in establishing similar results for other network architectures.},

For some highly structured nonconvex problems however, the success of gradient descent can be understood by studying the geometry of the objective. We study one such problem â€“ complete orthogonal dictionary learning, and provide converge guarantees for randomly initialized gradient descent to the neighborhood of a global optimum. The resulting rates scale as low order polynomials in the dimension even though the objective possesses an exponential number of saddle points. This efficient convergence can be viewed as a consequence of negative curvature normal to the stable manifolds associated with saddle points, and we provide evidence that this feature is shared by other nonconvex problems of importance as well.},

To achieve this, we devise a training protocol that employs a dataset and neural network of minimal sizes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on simulated data from a model of a well-established CS A2IC in the presence of linear impairments and noise. The recovery process extrapolates from training on 1-sparse signals to recovering the support of signals whose sparsity runs up to the theoretical optimum for \(\ell^1\) -based algorithms across a range of typical operating SNRs.},

                   perspective, popular deep networks such as transformers can
                   be naturally viewed as realizing iterative schemes to
                   optimize this objective incrementally. Particularly, we show
                   that the standard transformer block can be derived from
                   alternating optimization on complementary parts of this
                   objective: the multi-head self-attention operator can be
                   viewed as a gradient descent step to compress the token sets
                   by minimizing their lossy coding rate, and the subsequent
                   multi-layer perceptron can be viewed as attempting to
                   sparsify the representation of the tokens. This leads to a

                   effective for a wide range of downstream applications such as
                   segmentation and detection. Previous works have shown that
                   segmentation properties emerge in vision transformers (ViTs)
                   trained using self-supervised methods such as DINO, but not in
                   those trained on supervised classification tasks. In this study,
                   we probe whether segmentation emerges in transformer-based models
                   solely as a result of intricate self-supervised learning
                   mechanisms, or if the same emergence can be achieved under much

    representation learning is to compress and transform the distribution of the
      data, say sets of tokens, towards a low-dimensional Gaussian mixture
      supported on incoherent subspaces. The goodness of such a representation
      can be evaluated by a principled measure, called sparse rate reduction,
    that simultaneously maximizes the intrinsic information gain and extrinsic
      sparsity of the learned representation. From this perspective, popular
      deep network architectures, including transformers, can be viewed as
      realizing iterative schemes to optimize this measure. Particularly, we
      derive a transformer block from alternating optimization on parts of this
      objective: the multi-head self-attention operator compresses the
      representation by implementing an approximate gradient descent step on the
      coding rate of the features, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron
      sparsifies the features. This leads to a family of white-box
      transformer-like deep network architectures, named CRATE, which are
      mathematically fully interpretable. We show, by way of a novel connection
      between denoising and compression, that the inverse to the aforementioned
      compressive encoding can be realized by the same class of CRATE
      architectures. Thus, the so-derived white-box architectures are universal
      to both encoders and decoders. Experiments show that these networks,
    despite their simplicity, indeed learn to compress and sparsify
      representations of large-scale real-world image and text datasets, and
      achieve performance very close to highly engineered transformer-based
      models: ViT, MAE, DINO, BERT, and GPT2. We believe the proposed

Modern deep learning models have been brought to bear for these tasks too, as in the framework of plug-and-play or deep unrolling, where they loosely resemble proximal operators. Yet, something essential is lost in employing these purely data-driven approaches: there is no guarantee that a general deep network represents the proximal operator of any function, nor is there any characterization of the function for which the network might provide some approximate proximal. This not only makes guaranteeing convergence of iterative schemes challenging but, more fundamentally, complicates the analysis of what has been learned by these networks about their training data. Herein we provide a framework to develop learned proximal networks (LPN), prove that they provide exact proximal operators for a data-driven nonconvex regularizer, and show how a new training strategy, dubbed proximal matching, provably promotes the recovery of the log-prior of the true data distribution. Such LPN provide general, unsupervised, expressive proximal operators that can be used for general inverse problems with convergence guarantees. We illustrate our results in a series of cases of increasing complexity, demonstrating that these models not only result in state-of-the-art performance, but provide a window into the resulting priors learned from data. }

These networks are empirically designed; as such, they are usually not interpretable, their representations are not structured, and their designs are potentially redundant. White-box deep networks, in which each layer explicitly identifies and transforms structures in the data, present a promising alternative. However, existing white-box architectures have only been shown to work at scale in supervised settings with labeled data, such as classification. In this work, we provide the first instantiation of the white-box design paradigm that can be applied to large-scale unsupervised representation learning. We do this by exploiting a fundamental connection between diffusion, compression, and (masked) completion, deriving a deep transformer-like masked autoencoder architecture, called CRATE-MAE, in which the role of each layer is mathematically fully interpretable: they transform the data distribution to and from a structured representation. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm our analytical insights. CRATE-MAE demonstrates highly promising performance on large-scale imagery datasets while using only ~30\% of the parameters compared to the standard masked autoencoder with the same model configuration. The representations learned by CRATE-MAE have explicit structure and also contain semantic meaning.}
