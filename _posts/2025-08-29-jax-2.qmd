In this second post in a series on programming with JAX for training
models like transformers, we write and train a transformer with a decent set of
bells and whistles, then benchmark and scale it as much as we can on our TPU v4
half-cube!

As in previous posts in the series, we make good use of the Google scaling
playbook {% cite scaling-book %}, as well as some useful JAX tutorials, especially {%
cite jax-training-cookbook %}.

### Setup

As usual, we'll test things out in Python 3.13 and JAX 0.7.1 on a single TPU v4
host.

```python

import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

jax.devices()
```
```
Output:
[TpuDevice(id=0, process_index=0, coords=(0,0,0), core_on_chip=0),
 TpuDevice(id=1, process_index=0, coords=(1,0,0), core_on_chip=0),
 TpuDevice(id=2, process_index=0, coords=(0,1,0), core_on_chip=0),
 TpuDevice(id=3, process_index=0, coords=(1,1,0), core_on_chip=0)]
```

# Design Choices

A project like this is for learning and pedagogy---it's inevitably behind the
research/infra frontiers. So the code we write is going to lean into this
somewhat. Notably,

> *We'll implement everything in **bare-metal JAX**, rather than using
neural network libraries like Flax/nnx/Equinox.*

This will let us expose and
understand all the implementation details, both for infra and architecture, that
we might normally overlook. On the flip side, we'll take some performance hits
for this (which we'll attempt to profile and characterize), and it will lead to some
slightly unfortunate code repetition.[^1] We'll also be reinventing the wheel
throughout -- but for pedagogy's sake!

## Model Architecture Overview

Our approach to implementing the network architecture is a modification of the approach
used in the JAX training cookbook {% cite jax-training-cookbook %}, which uses a data
structure like those in Google's [ML
Collections](https://github.com/google/ml_collections) library to store the model. At a
high level, this approach consists of these standard JAX neural net patterns:
- Storing the model parameters as a [pytree](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/pytrees.html).
- Defining separate functions for initialization and the model's forward pass which take
  such a pytree as input (as well as other relevant inputs).
This pattern promotes functionally-pure code for the model's initialization and forward pass,
making it easy to `jit` for performance.

Our implementation tries to move this slightly in the direction of
[Equinox](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/), without all the powerful features that
library entails. In particular, we will:
- Use
  [NamedTuples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple)
  for parameters and layers (i.e., where you'd normally expect to use a `nn.Module` in
  Pytorch), enabling good static type checking with e.g. Pyright.
  NamedTuples are [automatically registered as
  pytrees](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/pytrees.html#internal-pytree-handling) in JAX!
- Write a top-level function for model initialization, and layer-level functions for
  each separate layer's operation (which, as above, take parameters and inputs as
  arguments). This is a 'bottom-up' version of the previous design, where we'll end up
  with many different functions, one for each 'layer', which are combined bottom-up to
  implement the overall model's forward pass (more like in a typical neural network
  library).


# Building the Model: First Cut

When writing this post, I wrote and debugged the initial model/training code iteratively
in a notebook. Rather than just jumping to the 'final answer', we'll walk through the
development process below.

In this part of the post, we'll build up to the transformer through a few simple
sub-modules of the overall model. Our targets will be:
- We'll work with a very simple data distribution, described below, which requires
  minimal dataloading code (and no tokenization).
- We'll focus on the training loss, leaving sampling for later. Although simple sampling
  gives us an important correctness test ("did we accidentally give the model access to
  future tokens?", for example...), doing it 'fast' requires a bit of code, so we'll
  save it for later.

On the way to these targets, we'll build up the following:
- Just the MLP, giving us a position-wise model (bigrams with a nonlinearity!).
- A training loop with SGD and cross-entropy (next token prediction) loss.
- Just causal attention, letting us build a transformer that can solve our toy task
  (discussed in the next section) with two layers.
- Rotary positional encodings, so that we can solve our task with a one-layer model.

We'll then step back and refactor things with an eye towards training larger models on
actual language data in a distributed setting.

If you're following along and you notice anything I've implemented that seems
suboptimal, please let me know! Drop me an email or a DM on Twitter (links at the bottom
of the page).

## A Quick Note on Configuration

For overall convenience, we eventually want to combine all our different configuration
options in a large dataclass, then pass our runtime instantiation of the config (with
defaults, overrides, etc.) to all our functions, which can extract just the parameters
they need.

When writing this code, I tend to define the config options I need locally, then go back
later and turn them into attributes of the overall config dataclass. To avoid
frontloading with all the complexity of the config, and to avoid too much unnecessary
description of the refactoring process, we'll reference different config options below
as attributes of an (as of yet undefined) Config class. Code outputs will also have this
class defined. You can Ctrl+F for type definitions and defaults, which will appear
later, if it feels necessary.

## Brief Setup

We are going to make reference to different sources of randomness below, which we seed
from our Config class.

```python
# Test it out
config = Config()
key = jax.random.key(config.seed)
key_params, key_data, key_sampling = jax.random.split(key, 3)
```


## Data

The data will consist of an (infinite) sequence of consecutive digits (from 0 to 9),
which 'reflect' when they reach 0 or 9. I.e.,
```
01234567898765432101...
```

We'll generate a dataset of fixed-length subsequences of this infinite sequence for
training.

```python
text = "012345678987654321" * 1024
seqs = [
    [int(c) for c in text[i : i + config.seq_len + 1]]
    for i in range(len(text) - config.seq_len - 1)
]
data = jnp.array(seqs, dtype=jnp.int32)


key_data, sk = jax.random.split(key_data)
data = jax.random.permutation(sk, data, axis=0)
num_data = len(data)
print(data[128])

Xtr = data[: int(0.8 * num_data)]
Xdev = data[int(0.8 * num_data) : int(0.9 * num_data)]
Xte = data[int(0.9 * num_data) :]
Xtr.shape
```
```
Output:
[8 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 8
 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 7
 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6
 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6 5
 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6]
(14540, 257)
```

We shuffle the sequences above and perform a simple train-dev-test split (although we'll
just use train for now). We take one more character than the sequence length, so that we
can easily turn these raw sequences into inputs and targets. We do this with a simple
dataloader:


```python
import itertools as it


def dataloader(key, config: Config):
    for step in it.count():
        key = jax.random.fold_in(key, step)
        offsets = jax.random.randint(key, (config.global_batch_size,), 0, num_data)
        yield (Xtr.at[offsets, :-1].get(), Xtr.at[offsets, 1:].get())


key_data, sk = jax.random.split(key_data)
batch = map(
    lambda batch: jax.device_put(batch, config.sharding_data),
    dataloader(sk, config),
)
```

Here `batch` is a map iterator which wraps the dataloader with a `device_put` statement to enforce
our desired sharding (e.g., data parallel). When we create our config class, we create a
global mesh and set it as the default mesh, so we can pass a `PartitionSpec` object to
`device_put` in our single-host setting (see the [previous post]({{ site.baseurl
}}/blog/jax-1)).

The batches being loaded have shape
`(config.global_batch_size, config.seq_len)`, so expect `config.sharding_data` to be
for example `jax.P('dp')` for a "data-parallel" mesh axis `'dp'`, which leads the batch
to be sharded across accelerators.

## Defining the Model: MLP

We'll implement the overarching structure of our model here, described above in the
"Design Choices" section, but keep the low-level implementations restricted to just the
MLP.

We'll follow the following conventions:
- "Layers" correspond to `NamedTuples` (which are pytrees). The elements of such a
  "layer" can be either `jax.Array`s (parameters/pytree leaves), or other NamedTuples
  (for composing layers).
- We'll name our layers with capital letters, and the functions that implement them
  (i.e., their "forward" method in Pytorch lingo) in lower-case, with a leading
  underscore.

Here's our MLP layer following these conventions:

```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class Mlp(NamedTuple):
    w_up: jax.Array
    bias_up: jax.Array
    w_down: jax.Array
    bias_down: jax.Array


def _mlp(config: Config, params: Mlp, x: jax.Array):
    preact = jnp.dot(x, params.w_up, out_sharding=config.sharding_mlp_hidden)
    if config.use_bias_mlp:
        preact += params.bias_up
    act = jax.nn.gelu(preact, approximate=True)
    out = jnp.dot(act, params.w_down, out_sharding=config.sharding_res_stream)
    if config.use_bias_mlp:
        out += params.bias_down
    return out
```

We would create parameters for such a layer and apply it as follows:

```python
my_mlp = Mlp(
    w_up=jnp.zeros((2, 4)),
    bias_up=jnp.zeros((4,)),
    w_down=jnp.zeros((4, 2)),
    bias_down=jnp.zeros((2,)),
)
_mlp(config, my_mlp, jnp.ones((2,)))
```
```
Output:
Array([0., 0.], dtype=float32)
```

It's important to note here that we are **not** able to enforce shape information at
this level of implementation, since abstractly speaking an MLP can be implemented for
any compatible weight matrix dimensions. These shapes get enforced later, when we
initialize an `Mlp` with settings specified in our `config` instance.

More importantly, there is some ambiguity in the types of the arguments `x` and `params`
that `_mlp` will apply to -- e.g. the above function could apply to `x` being a vector
of shape `(d_model,)`, or a matrix of shape `(seq_len, d_model)`, as long as the
parameters of `Mlp` are initialized correctly. In other words, it's up to us to make
sure we apply this implementation correctly.

In our subsequent implementation, we're going to follow a helpful principle that JAX
affords -- we'll operate at the finest level of granularity possible at every stage of
the model, and 'move up' to the next level of granularity as necessary, using JAX's
powerful primitives like `vmap` and `scan`. In particular, we'll see soon that we'll
only use the above `_mlp` function in cases where `x` is a vector of shape `(d_model,)`.
Since the MLPs in transformers operate the same on every position in the sequence,
and every sequence in the batch, we'll just `vmap` our `_mlp` function when we need to
use it at the next level of granularity! This is a pretty empowering design strategy
that JAX enables: it lets us write our code's core numerical functionality without
having to plan ahead for exactly how it will be used later, making implementation
simpler and separating complexity nicely.

A few other notes (some drawbacks of this bare metal approach, which
seem unvaoidable):
- There's no 'state' in the `_mlp` function -- it just performs the operation of a MLP
  given parameters/inputs. This makes it easy to `jit`.
- Initialization is **not** handled here -- we'll have to do it later,
  since we want to initialize the entire transformer (top-down) in one shot.
- We enforce shardings for the hidden activations/output of the MLP in the `_mlp`
  function. We enforce shardings for the *parameters* of the MLP when we initialize them
  (see later).

## Defining the Model: Embeddings and Placeholders

To have a basic working model, we need token embeddings (mapping the raw integer tokens
we generated above to vectors the transformer can operate on), unembeddings (mapping the
vector outputs of the transformer to logits, which we can map to a probability
distribution over tokens to predict with), and normalization layers. We'll have
attention layers too, eventually; for now, we'll make a placeholder function for the
attention layer.


```python
class Attn(NamedTuple):
    w_qkv: jax.Array
    w_o: jax.Array


def _attn(
    config: Config,
    params: Attn,
    x_seq: jax.Array,
    kv_cache: jax.Array,
    cache_size: int,
):
    return x_seq, kv_cache


class Embedding(NamedTuple):
    w: jax.Array


def _embedding(config: Config, params: Embedding, token: jax.Array):
    emb = params.w.at[token].get(out_sharding=config.sharding_res_stream)
    return emb


class Unembedding(NamedTuple):
    w: jax.Array


def _unembedding(config: Config, params: Unembedding, x: jax.Array):
    logits = jnp.dot(x, params.w, out_sharding=config.sharding_res_stream)
    return logits


class LayerNorm(NamedTuple):
    gamma: jax.Array
    beta: jax.Array


def _layernorm(config: Config, params: LayerNorm, x: jax.Array):
    x_std = jax.nn.standardize(x.astype(config.compute_dtype), epsilon=config.eps_ln)
    out = params.gamma * x_std.astype(config.param_dtype)
    if config.use_bias_ln:
        out += params.beta
    return out
```

These are standard unoptimized implementations for these different building blocks.
Looking ahead slightly, we make sure to provide the ability to compute the layer
normalization operation in a higher precision (`config.compute_dtype`), since the
variance operation in `standardize` can lead to underflow and other losses of precision.
The API for `_attn` involves arguments for utilizing a cache for faster inference (we'd
normally leave this out to begin with, and add it only later).

## Defining the Model: Building Blocks to Transformer

A transformer consists of an embedding, then a sequence of transformer blocks (which
involve normalization + attention and a residual connection, then normalization + MLP
and a residual connection), then the unembedding.
Accordingly, we make a `Block` class which combines our low-level building blocks.

```python
from functools import partial


class Block(NamedTuple):
    norm_attn: LayerNorm
    attn: Attn
    norm_mlp: LayerNorm
    mlp: Mlp


def _block(
    config: Config,
    params: Block,
    x_seq: jax.Array,
    cache_in: jax.Array,
    cache_size: int,
):
    att_skip = x_seq
    out = jax.vmap(partial(_layernorm, config, params.norm_attn))(x_seq)
    out, cache_out = _attn(
        config, params.attn, out, kv_cache=cache_in, cache_size=cache_size
    )
    out += att_skip

    mlp_skip = out
    out = jax.vmap(partial(_layernorm, config, params.norm_mlp))(out)
    out = jax.vmap(partial(_mlp, config, params.mlp))(out)
    out += mlp_skip

    return out, cache_out
```

Notice that we're following the design principle we mentioned above with the MLP: here
we expect `x_seq` to have two dimensions, the first for the sequence length and the
second for the model dimension, and we `vmap` the `_mlp` and `_layernorm` functions to
apply to it correctly.

We can now define the transformer. We'll do this in a slightly refined way versus just
using a for loop: we'll expect the `blocks` parameter below, of type `Block`, to have a
mapped leading axis corresponding to the *layer dimension*, and we'll consume this
leading axis using a `scan`. That means we expect every parameter in the `Block` pytree
we pass to not just have its usual shape, say `param.shape` (expected by the `_mlp`,
etc. APIs above), but additionally be of shape `(num_layers,) + param.shape`. This turns
out to be very easy to guarantee with a `vmap` at initialization (see below).

If you aren't familiar with `scan`, you can read
about the API [here](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.scan.html).
It takes a function that accepts two arguments -- a 'carry' and an 'input' -- and
produces one output, as well as an 'initial' carry, and an initial input, which **must**
have an additional mapped axis somewhere relative to the input shape the function
argument expects. It will then iteratively apply the function to the current carry and
the current input; the output carry is passed to the next call of the function. In this
way, it's like a vectorized for loop -- you can also draw a direct analogy to a
recurrent neural network, or other dynamical systems.

In our case, the 'carry' for scan is our network's input and activations (we pass these
from layer to layer sequentially), and the 'input' for scan is the mapped `Block` pytree
(as well as the mapped KV cache for inference -- the updated cache becomes the output --
but we can ignore that for now).

```python
class Transformer(NamedTuple):
    emb: Embedding
    blocks: Block  # vmapped at init
    unemb: Unembedding


def _transformer(
    config: Config,
    params: Transformer,
    tokens: Array,
    cache_in: jax.Array,
    cache_size: int = 0,
):
    x_seq = jax.vmap(partial(_embedding, config, params.emb))(tokens)

    def _block_fun(x_seq: Array, params__cache_in: tuple[Block, jax.Array]):
        params, cache_in = params__cache_in
        return _block(config, params, x_seq, cache_in, cache_size)

    out, cache_out = jax.lax.scan(_block_fun, x_seq, (params.blocks, cache_in))

    out = jax.vmap(partial(_unembedding, config, params.unemb))(out)

    return out, cache_out
```

Using `scan` leads to a very concise forward pass definition for the transformer. Note
that our transformer is still operating on sequences of embeddings -- we'll apply it to
a batch of sequences with `vmap` later!

## Defining the Model: Initialization

The last step before testing is to initialize the model. This leads to a long
definition, but the intrinsic complexity is not high.

```python
def init_model_params(key, config: Config) -> Transformer:
    def init_embedding(key) -> Embedding:
        emb = config.param_std * jax.random.normal(
            key,
            (config.num_vocab, config.d_model),
            config.param_dtype,
            out_sharding=config.sharding_res_stream,
        )
        return Embedding(w=emb)

    def init_unembedding(key) -> Unembedding:
        unemb = config.param_std * jax.random.normal(
            key,
            (config.d_model, config.num_vocab),
            config.param_dtype,
            out_sharding=config.sharding_res_stream,
        )
        return Unembedding(w=unemb)

    def init_mlp(key) -> Mlp:
        k_w_up, k_w_down = jax.random.split(key, 2)
        w_up = config.param_std * jax.random.normal(
            k_w_up,
            (config.d_model, config.mlp_factor * config.d_model),
            config.param_dtype,
            out_sharding=config.sharding_wup,
        )
        w_down = config.param_std * (
            jax.random.normal(
                k_w_down,
                (config.mlp_factor * config.d_model, config.d_model),
                config.param_dtype,
                out_sharding=config.sharding_wdown,
            )
        )
        bias_up = jnp.zeros(
            (config.mlp_factor * config.d_model,),
            config.param_dtype,
            out_sharding=config.sharding_mlp_hidden,
        )
        bias_down = jnp.zeros(
            (config.d_model,),
            config.param_dtype,
            out_sharding=config.sharding_res_stream,
        )
        return Mlp(w_up=w_up, bias_up=bias_up, w_down=w_down, bias_down=bias_down)

    def init_attn(key) -> Attn:
        k_qkv, k_o = jax.random.split(key, 2)
        w_qkv = config.param_std * jax.random.normal(
            k_qkv,
            (config.d_model, 3, config.num_heads, config.d_head),
            config.param_dtype,
            out_sharding=jax.P(*config.sharding_wqkv),
        )
        w_out = config.param_std * (
            jax.random.normal(
                k_o,
                (config.d_head, config.num_heads, config.d_model),
                config.param_dtype,
                out_sharding=jax.P(*config.sharding_wo),
            )
        )
        return Attn(w_qkv=w_qkv, w_o=w_out)

    def init_layernorm() -> LayerNorm:
        gamma = jnp.ones(
            (config.d_model,),
            config.param_dtype,
            out_sharding=config.sharding_res_stream,
        )
        beta = jnp.zeros(
            (config.d_model,),
            config.param_dtype,
            out_sharding=config.sharding_res_stream,
        )
        return LayerNorm(gamma=gamma, beta=beta)

    def init_block(key) -> Block:
        key_attn, key_mlp = jax.random.split(key)
        return Block(
            norm_attn=init_layernorm(),
            attn=init_attn(key_attn),
            norm_mlp=init_layernorm(),
            mlp=init_mlp(key_mlp),
        )

    # Make the full network
    key_emb, key_blocks, key_unemb = jax.random.split(key, 3)
    keys_blocks = jax.random.split(key_blocks, config.num_layers)
    return Transformer(
        emb=init_embedding(key_emb),
        blocks=jax.vmap(init_block)(keys_blocks),
        unemb=init_unembedding(key_unemb),
    )
```

Notice above how we produce the mapped axis needed for the `scan` in the `_transformer`
function above: we just split our PRNGKey into an array of keys, one for each layer, and
`vmap` the `init_block` function over the array of keys. Easy!

## Testing the Basic Model

We can perform a quick test to make sure everything above is at least syntactically
correct. There are two things we want to see:
1. Can we run the model in eager mode?
2. Can we `jit` the model?

We really only care about 2 (it implies 1), so let's test it.

```python
key_params, sk = jax.random.split(key_params)
tf = init_model_params(sk, config)

print("Number of layers in model: ", config.num_layers)
print("Model dimension: ", config.d_model)

cache = None
tokens = jnp.arange(10)

In particular, the initial outputs are not very uniform, which we would like to have.
However, we should still be able to learn -- our network is not very deep.

## A Minimal Training Loop

Now we have enough to train a model. A simple training loop follows, using SGD.
First, we set up the training step, `jit`ting it for performance.

```python
class TrainState(NamedTuple):
    params: Transformer
    opt: None


@jax.jit
def init_train_state(key, config: Config) -> TrainState:
    return TrainState(params=init_model_params(key, config), opt=None)


train_state = init_train_state(key_params, config)
cache = None


@partial(jax.jit, donate_argnums=2)
def train_step(config: Config, batch, train_state: TrainState):
    def loss_fn(params: Transformer):
        inputs, targets = batch
        logits, cache_out = jax.vmap(partial(_transformer, config, params))(
            inputs, cache
        )
        logits = logits.astype(config.compute_dtype)
        logprobs = jax.nn.log_softmax(logits, axis=-1)
        return -jnp.take_along_axis(logprobs, targets[..., None], axis=-1).mean()

    loss, grad = jax.value_and_grad(loss_fn)(train_state.params)
    new_state = TrainState(
        params=jax.tree.map(lambda x, y: x - config.lr * y, train_state.params, grad),
        opt=None,
    )

    metrics = {"loss": loss}
    return metrics, new_state
```

In the training step, after loading a batch of sequences from our previously-written
batch loader, we vmap `_transformer` over it, then calculate the next-token prediction
loss with the standard bare-metal approach (with possible up-casting for numerical
stability of the softmax). The `donate_argnums` argument to `jit` lets us mark that the
`train_state` buffer can be discarded after the step finishes (since we create and
return a new `TrainState` with the results of the SGD step), letting the `XLA` compiler
reuse that memory for the output state.

The loop is then simple to write:

```python
prev_metrics = None
for step in range(config.num_steps):
    cur_metrics, train_state = train_step(config, next(batch), train_state)
    log_metrics, prev_metrics = prev_metrics, cur_metrics
    if log_metrics and step % 50 == 0:
        log_metrics |= {"step": step}
        print(*[f"{metric}: {val}" for metric, val in log_metrics.items()], sep="\t")
```





```
Output:

```

It's not great, but it's indeed training! We don't expect to be able to solve this task
perfectly with our simple model, since a position-wise MLP can only use one token of
context to predict the next token, and our task requires at least two. To see why, just
note that, for example, the character following `5` could be either `6` or `4`,
depending on whether we're at a rising or falling part of the sequence. Two characters
of context is enough to estimate this, meaning adding attention should help here!

As an aside, above, we make sure to print metrics for the *previous* iteration of the
training loop at each step. This helps with correctly pipelining host to data transfers:
see {% cite jax-training-cookbook %} for a detailed description.


# Sampling from the Model: First Cut

To get a sense of the behavior of our learned model, we can write our sampler for it
now. Normally, efficient sampling requires a cache of past outputs to be maintained (we
already have the API for this), but we'll discuss this later after we implement
attention.


```python
@partial(jax.jit, donate_argnums=(4,))
def sample_one_token(
    config: Config,
    key,
    params: Transformer,
    x: jax.Array,
    cache_in: jax.Array,
    cache_size: int,
    temperature: float,
):
    y, cache_out = _transformer(config, params, x, cache_in, cache_size)
    logits = y.astype(config.compute_dtype)
    cache_size = cache_size + x.shape[-1]
    next_token = jnp.array((jax.random.categorical(key, logits[-1] / temperature),))
    return next_token, cache_out, cache_size
```

```python
config_sampling_args = {"sharding_data": jax.P()}
config_sampling = Config(**config_sampling_args)

output = jnp.array((1,))
cache = None
tokens_to_generate = 63
temperature = 0.1
for step in range(tokens_to_generate):
    key_sampling, sk = jax.random.split(key_sampling)
    next_token, cache, cache_size = sample_one_token(
        config_sampling, sk, train_state.params, output, cache, 0, temperature
    )
    output = jnp.concatenate((output, next_token))
output
```


```
Output:
Array([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1, 2, 3,
       2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 5, 6, 5,
       6, 5, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2],      dtype=int32)
```


We set a relatively high temperature in order to better highlight what the model has
learned. The generated sequence is in line with our hypothesis -- the model has lowered
the loss by learning that it needs to predict the number that's one above or one below
the current input, but it can't do much better than guessing randomly between these two
possibilities (hence why our final loss is close to $\log(2)$).

Let's improve this with attention!

# Building the Model: Attention and Positional Encodings

An attention implementation that follows `jax.nn.dot_product_attention` shape
conventions follows, with both manual implementations and one using this function.
For now, we omit the cache implementation and positional embedding implementation.

```python
def _attn(
    config: Config,
    params: Attn,
    x_seq: jax.Array,
    kv_cache: jax.Array,
    cache_size: int,
):
    # s: sequence length
    # d: embedding dim (config.d_model)
    # n: attention heads (config.num_heads)
    # h: head dim (config.d_head)
    # x_seq: s x d

    qkv = jnp.einsum(
        "sd,d3nh->3snh",
        x_seq,
        params.w_qkv,
        out_sharding=jax.P(*config.sharding_att_qkv),
    )
    q, k, v = [qkv[i] for i in range(3)]
    s = q.shape[0]

    # Attention computation
    t = k.shape[0]
    mask = (cache_size + jnp.arange(s))[:, None] >= jnp.arange(t)[None, :]
    mask = mask[None, ...]  # broadcast over heads
    if config.use_fa:
        attn_out = jax.nn.dot_product_attention(q, k, v, scale=None, mask=mask)
    else:
        logits = jnp.einsum("snh,tnh->nst", q, k).astype(config.compute_dtype)
        # Scale and causal mask
        logits *= 1.0 / config.d_head**0.5
        logits = jnp.where(mask, logits, -jnp.inf)
        probs = jax.nn.softmax(logits, axis=2)  # type: ignore[reportArgumentType]
        probs = probs.astype(config.param_dtype)
        attn_out = jnp.einsum("nst,tnh->snh", probs, v)
    out = jnp.einsum(
        "snh,hnd->sd",
        attn_out,
        params.w_o,
        out_sharding=jax.P(*config.sharding_res_stream),
    )

    return out, kv_cache
```

Attention takes the embeddings of the input sequences $\vX \in \bbR^{S \times D}$ as
input. It computes $N$ "attention heads", then combines them to form the output.
Each head, indexed by $n \in [N]$, is generated from different projections of the input
embedding sequences: we calculate

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vQ_n = \vX \vW_{Q, n}, \quad \vK_n = \vX \vW_{K, n}, \quad \vV_n = \vX \vW_{V, n},
\end{equation*}
$$

where the output dimension of the projections is $H$, then generate the head output as

$$
\begin{equation*}
\vA_n = \mathrm{softmax}(\vQ_n \vK_n^\top + \vM) \vV_n,
\end{equation*}
$$

with the softmax being taken along rows, and $\vM$ denoting a causal mask:

$$
M_{ij} = \begin{cases}
0 & i \leq j \\
-\infty & \ow.
\end{cases}
$$

The heads are then concatenated together along the embedding dimension, producing an $S
\times NH$ dimensional result (usually $NH = D$), and then an output projection $\vW_O$
is applied to produce the attention output, which has the same shape as the input $\vX$.
The code above implements these operations concisely with `jnp.einsum`.

We can replace our previous placeholder attention implementation with a complete one and
then rerun our training loop, since we already added the proper initialization code
above.

Two back-to-back output traces are posted above. We can get a sense that this model
*should* be able to learn to solve the task, but the poor optimizer (constant learning
rate SGD) is holding it back. If we rerun the sampling code above with the new model at
low temperature (`temperature=0.1`), we do get correct outputs:

```
Output:
Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
       5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
       9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8],      dtype=int32)
```

Yet the final loss is suggestive that the model we've learned is not very good.
We can improve the model further by incorporating positional encodings. We'll use the
modern choice, rotary positional encodings (RoPE). There are already many great blogs
explaining the intuition behind these encodings, so I'll just focus here on the
algebraic ideas.

The basic idea is to consider the dot product of a query-key pair forming one head's
attention matrix $\vA$, as we defined it above (dropping the subscript $n$ for
concision). Ignoring the mask, for the $ij$-th entry of this attention matrix, we
consider the dot product ("attention logits") $\vq_i \vk_j^\top$.
A notable property of attention is that the only dependence of its output on the
position $i$ is through the causal mask $\vM$: if we drop the mask, then permuting the
input positions produces a corresponding permutation of the output positions,
because every position receives the same projections $\vW_{QKV}$.[^2]

This is arguably undesirable: the model benefits in many cases from the ability to learn
a sequence-to-sequence mapping that is more position sensitive. For example, in our toy
data setting, the model would be able to learn a good mapping faster if it were able to
selectively focus on only a small number of past tokens (since this is enough to
determine whether we're in a "rising" or "falling" part of the sequence).

A nice way to incorporate this positional information is through a *relative* positional
embedding. In such a method, we modify the attention operation so that the attention
logits incorporate the magnitude of the difference in positions $\abs{i - j}$. In RoPE,
this is done by inducing a quadratic form

$$
\begin{equation*}
    \vq_i \vR_{\abs{i-j}} \vk_j^\top,
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\vR_{\abs{i-j}}$ is a specific rotation matrix.[^3] RoPE's choice of this matrix has
the useful property that for fixed-norm keys and queries, the magnitude of the encoded
attention logits *decays* as a function of $\abs{i-j}$, giving *a priori* less weight to
logits of positions that are further apart.

It also has the essential property that the encoded logits can be computed efficiently.
It turns out that there are (real-valued) sequences $\vc_i$, $\vs_i$ corresponding to each
position, such that the following holds. Let $\vPi \in \bbR^{H \times H}$ denote the
permutation matrix that reverses the top $H/2$ coordinates of a vector with the bottom
$H/2$ coordinates (assume $H$ is even).[^4] Then one has

$$
\begin{equation*}
    \vq_i \vR_{\abs{i-j}} \vk_j^\top
    =
    (\vq_i \circ \vc_i + \vPi \vq_i \circ \vs_i)
    (\vk_j \circ \vc_j + \vPi \vk_j \circ \vs_j)^\top,
\end{equation*}
$$

where matrix multiplication binds before elementwise multiplication $\circ$. In
particular, we can compute the encoded logits via a small number of elementwise
multiplications, adds, and concatenations involving the raw keys and queries, which
leads to a minimal-complexity implementation. The sequences $\vc_i, \vs_i$ depend only
on position, and can be precomputed and reused.

We give a simple implementation of RoPE below, and its integration into our attention
layer we implemented previously.

```python
def _precompute_rope_sincos(config: Config):
    freqs = jnp.exp(
        -jnp.log(config.rope_theta).astype(config.compute_dtype)
        * 2
        / config.d_head
        * jnp.arange(config.d_head // 2, out_sharding=jax.P())
    )
    positions = jnp.arange(config.max_seq_len, out_sharding=jax.P())
    cycles = positions[:, None] * freqs[None, :]
    return jnp.cos(cycles), jnp.sin(cycles)

    )

        x_seq,
        params.w_qkv,

    )
    q, k, v = [qkv[i] for i in range(3)]
    s = q.shape[0]

    # Apply RoPE

        )
        _apply_rope_all_heads = jax.vmap(_apply_rope_one_head, in_axes=1, out_axes=1)
        q, k = _apply_rope_all_heads(q), _apply_rope_all_heads(k)

    # Attention computation
    t = k.shape[0]
    mask = (cache_size + jnp.arange(s))[:, None] >= jnp.arange(t)[None, :]
    mask = mask[None, ...]  # broadcast over heads
    if config.use_fa:
        attn_out = jax.nn.dot_product_attention(q, k, v, scale=None, mask=mask)
    else:

        # Scale and causal mask
        logits *= 1.0 / config.d_head**0.5
        logits = jnp.where(mask, logits, -jnp.inf)
        probs = jax.nn.softmax(logits, axis=2)  # type: ignore[reportArgumentType]
        probs = probs.astype(config.param_dtype)
        attn_out = jnp.einsum("nst,tnh->snh", probs, v)
    out = jnp.einsum(

        attn_out,
        params.w_o,
        out_sharding=jax.P(*config.sharding_res_stream),
    )

    return out, kv_cache
```

The changes to the `_attn` function are all within the code block marked with `# Apply
RoPE` (everything else is unchanged); the `_apply_rope` function takes care of the
necessary permutation/concatenation operation. We use JAX's `ensure_compile_time_eval`
context manager to ensure the RoPE multiplying sequences are precomputed. The
multiplying sequences themselves are chosen to have geometrically-varying time values,
with a rate parameter `rope_theta` set to `1e4` by default (in general, set based on the
target context length, here 1024).

With RoPE, we find it much easier to learn a strong model for our toy data.
After rerunning training with these modifications, we observe the following loss
progression:

```

```

Much better! For a completely overconfident model, we might expect to have loss around
$\log(2) / 256 \approx 0.002$, corresponding to randomly guessing for the first token in
each sequence of the batch (we train with sequence length `256`). This is within about
an order of magnitude.


# Building the Model: Sampling with a Cache

The implementation of sampling we gave above is extremely slow: although we `jit` the
`sample_one_token` function, we are re-forwarding the entire updated sequence through
the model after every generation, which is very wasteful. A quick test on our
previously-implemented sampling function (on 1x TPU v4 host) takes about 50 seconds to
sample 63 tokens, including the time to `jit` compile the sampling function.

This makes sense, given our naive implementation. Indeed, if we recall the attention
definition, at the $i$-th token each head computes

$$
\begin{equation*}
    \mathrm{softmax}( \vq_i \vK^T ) \vV,
\end{equation*}
$$

and the output projection just accumulates these independent heads and 'lifts' the head
dimension $H$ to the output dimension $D$.
In other words, if we were to save the previous key and value tokens $(\vk_j,
\vv_j)_{j=1}^{i-1}$ in a cache, we could reuse these to compute each head's attention
output with no wasted operations: we'd just need to compute $\vk_i$ and $\vv_i$ for the
current position, then load the previous positions' keys and values from the cache to
compute the full attention output.

This data structure is called a *KV cache*, and it's essential for fast inference, since
autoregressive operation implies we can only compute one token at a time (in contrast to
training, where we forward an entire batch of sequences at once).
A back-of-the-envelope analysis suggests that the naive sampling strategy (re-forward
the entire sequence on every new token generation) takes $O(S^2D^2 + DS^3)$ FLOPs to
generate an $S$-length sequence starting from an empty prompt, whereas the KV caching
strategy takes only $O(SD^2 + DS^2)$ FLOPs. This is a significant savings!

The catch is that the KV caching strategy requires significantly more memory accesses
and usage compared to the naive approach. In JAX, we also need to be careful to
implement the KV cache 'correctly' -- since the cache grows after every generation,
naive implementations can entail inputs of different sizes to `_attn` (triggering a
re-compilation every time we call it, when it's `jit`ted!), or dynamically-sized arrays
(not allowed within a `jit` context!).[^6]

Our simple implementation of the KV cache is below. Since we left the API for the cache
in the code we've written already, we just need to implement its functionality in the
`_attn` function, and add a function to initialize an empty cache. To play nice with
`jit`, we will implement a static-sized cache with a fixed size `config.max_seq_len`
(the same parameter we used for RoPE), ensuring we can `jit` the `_attn` function only
once, and maintain an auxilary `cache_size` variable to keep track of how much we've
written to the cache. To avoid having dynamically-sized arrays in the `_attn` function,
we are a bit wasteful and zero-initialize the cache, then just multiply the current
query $\vq_i$ against the entire cache on every attention operation.[^5] To avoid having
these extra keys influence the attention computation (since softmaxing them produces a
nonzero output!), we augment the attention mask to mask them out.

The implementation is below.

```python
def _attn(
    config: Config,
    params: Attn,
    x_seq: jax.Array,
    kv_cache: jax.Array,  # 2 x config.max_seq_len x n x h (see below)
    cache_size: int,
):
    # s: sequence length
    # d: embedding dim (config.d_model)
    # n: attention heads (config.num_heads)
    # h: head dim (config.d_head)
    # x_seq: s x d

    qkv = jnp.einsum(
        "sd,d3nh->3snh",
        x_seq,
        params.w_qkv,
        out_sharding=jax.P(*config.sharding_att_qkv),
    )
    q, k, v = [qkv[i] for i in range(3)]
    s = q.shape[0]  # we save k shape later, after possibly prepending cache

    # Apply RoPE
    if config.use_rope:
        if not config.update_cache:
            cache_size = 0  # ignore passed value
        with jax.ensure_compile_time_eval():
            rope_cos, rope_sin = _precompute_rope_sincos(config)
        positions = jnp.arange(s, out_sharding=jax.P())
        _apply_rope_one_head = partial(
            _apply_rope, config, rope_cos, rope_sin, positions + cache_size
        )
        _apply_rope_all_heads = jax.vmap(_apply_rope_one_head, in_axes=1, out_axes=1)
        q, k = _apply_rope_all_heads(q), _apply_rope_all_heads(k)

    # Read/update/concatenate the cache
    if config.update_cache:
        k_cache, v_cache = kv_cache[0], kv_cache[1]
        k = jax.lax.dynamic_update_slice(k_cache, k, (cache_size, 0, 0))
        v = jax.lax.dynamic_update_slice(v_cache, v, (cache_size, 0, 0))
        kv_cache_out = jnp.concatenate((k[None], v[None]), axis=0)
    else:
        kv_cache_out = kv_cache
        cache_size = 0  # ignore passed value

    # Attention computation
    t = k.shape[0]
    mask = (cache_size + jnp.arange(s))[:, None] >= jnp.arange(t)[None, :]
    # with static kv cache, must mask unused memory!
    mask = mask & (jnp.arange(t)[None, :] < cache_size + s)
    mask = mask[None, ...]  # broadcast over heads
    if config.use_fa:
        attn_out = jax.nn.dot_product_attention(q, k, v, scale=None, mask=mask)
    else:
        logits = jnp.einsum("snh,tnh->nst", q, k).astype(config.compute_dtype)
        # Scale and causal mask
        logits *= 1.0 / config.d_head**0.5
        logits = jnp.where(mask, logits, -jnp.inf)
        probs = jax.nn.softmax(logits, axis=2)  # type: ignore[reportArgumentType]
        probs = probs.astype(config.param_dtype)
        attn_out = jnp.einsum("nst,tnh->snh", probs, v)
    out = jnp.einsum(
        "snh,hnd->sd",
        attn_out,
        params.w_o,
        out_sharding=jax.P(*config.sharding_res_stream),
    )

    return out, kv_cache_out


def init_kv_cache(config: Config):
    return jnp.zeros(
        (
            config.global_batch_size,
            config.num_layers,
            2,
            config.max_seq_len,
            config.num_heads,
            config.d_head,
        ),
        dtype=config.param_dtype,
        out_sharding=config.sharding_data + jax.P(None) + config.sharding_att_qkv,
    )
```

Running this block and then rerunning our training script shows that our changes haven't
broken anything. We can test how much it speeds up sampling, as well. We modify the
sampler above slightly -- we enable the cache in the config, and forward one token per
sampling step to the model, rather than the entire output, as the cache will store all
the context.

```python
config_sampling_args = {"sharding_data": jax.P(), "update_cache": True}
config_sampling = Config(**config_sampling_args)

next_token = jnp.array((1,))
output = next_token
cache = init_kv_cache(config_sampling)[0]
cache_size = 0
tokens_to_generate = 63
temperature = 0.1
for step in range(tokens_to_generate):
    key_sampling, sk = jax.random.split(key_sampling)
    next_token, cache, cache_size = sample_one_token(
        config_sampling,
        sk,
        train_state.params,
        next_token,
        cache,
        cache_size,
        temperature,
    )
    output = jnp.concatenate((output, next_token))
output
```
```
Output:
Array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
       5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
       9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8],      dtype=int32)
```

Correct outputs!
The runtime is about 2 seconds including the `jit` compilation time on the first run,
and `0.5` seconds on subsequent runs (since the static cache and
one-token-input-per-sampling-step means the `jit`ted sampler sees the same input shapes
on every call). Quite a speedup!

# Conclusions

In this blog post, we've built up:
- A simple `jit`table transformer model with RoPE;
- A basic training loop with SGD and toy data (digit alphabet);
- A minimal `jit`table sampler with a static KV cache.

All in bare-metal JAX.

Since the length is already nontrivial, we'll save further extensions -- refactoring
into a python package, improving the config scaffolding for running experiments and
adding distributed training support, improving the optimizer, and training on actual
language data -- to the next post.
I hope this exposition is helpful to learners of JAX and transformers -- writing it has
been very helpful to me!

[^1]: Namely, because we won't have a clean way to combine our model
    parameter definitions with the actual application of the model.

[^2]: The causal mask actually *is* enough to enable sequence-to-sequence mappings that
    depend on position to be learned in multi-layer transformers. The recent trend of
    "NoPE" (no positional encoding) in open-source large models is evidence of this.

[^3]: It's actually a block-diagonal rotation matrix, with $2 \times 2$ blocks. This is
    what leads to the efficient approach to computing its induced quadratic form below!

[^4]: In code, for a list `v`, this is just `v[H//2:] + v[:H//2]`. Moreover, the choice
    of the permutation $\vPi$ is not essential (because the coordinates of the embedded
    keys and queries follow a learnable linear transformation), and can be changed for
    either mathematical clarity or code clarity (we choose based on the latter; the
    original RoPE paper emphasized the former).

[^5]: Although this *feels* very wasteful, it actually only loses (asymptotically) a
    factor of $2$ in FLOPs versus the optimal implementation.

[^6]: Actually, our naive sampling implementation above, which re-forwards the entire
    sequence after concatenating, runs so slow because the *input* to the transformer
    keeps growing in size -- which triggers a recompilation after every generation!
    Avoiding these pitfalls is a general challenge in JAX.
