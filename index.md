I am a Research Assistant Professor at [TTIC](https://ttic.edu).  I completed
my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at [Columbia
University](https://ee.columbia.edu) in 2022, working with [John
Wright](http://www.columbia.edu/~jw2966/), and my B.S. in Electrical
Engineering at the [University of Kansas](https://eecs.ku.edu).


My research studies the mathematics of representation learning from the
perspective of signals and data. I'm interested in questions that span theory
and practice &mdash; What structural properties of modern data play a role in the
success or failure of deep learning? How can we design better deep
architectures by exploiting these structures? I'm especially interested in
applications to visual data. 

## Recent Updates

- (August 2023) To appear at ICCV 2023: A new hybrid neural field architecture
  for implicit 3D representation, [TILTED](https://brentyi.github.io/tilted/).
  Featuring a [throwback mixture of theory and
  practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15461), wherein we prove that our method
  succeeds under idealized conditions and dig into the mathematics of
  pose-appearance disentanglement in visual data.

- (August 2023) [New preprint posted](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01129)
  on understanding the transformer architecture from first-principles signal
  models, and a consequent white-box redesign of the architecture that
  maintains strong performance at the ImageNet-21K scale and shows promising
  representation learning ability: for example, [whole-parts input segmentation
  emerges in its self-attention maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16271) without
  any specialized self-supervised training.

- (July 2023) I am a co-organizer of the inaugural [Conference on Parsimony and Learning
  (CPAL)](https://cpal.cc), a new
  conference aiming to unite researchers working at the interface of AI/ML and
  low-dimensional structures in data. Please consider submitting your best work
  to the ["Recent
  Spotlight"](https://cpal.cc/tracks/#recent-spotlight-track-non-archival)
  (workshop) track, deadline [October
  10th](https://cpal.cc/deadlines/#conference-submission-recent-spotlight-track)!

- (June 2023) We taught a short course at ICASSP 2023 in Rhodes, Greece, titled
  ["Learning Nonlinear and Deep Low-Dimensional Representations from High-Dimensional Data: From Theory to Practice"](https://highdimdata-lowdimmodels-tutorial.github.io/).
  Slides are available at the course website.

- (January 2023) I co-organized the third [Workshop on Seeking Low-Dimensionality in Deep Neural Networks (SLowDNN)](https://slowdnn-workshop.github.io/). Thanks to all speakers and
  students for a very successful workshop, and to our hosts at MBZUAI.  [Here
  is a link to my
  tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO39D_Jfq_E&t=3s&pp=ygUMc2FtIGJ1Y2hhbmFu).
