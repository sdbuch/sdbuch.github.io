I am a postdoctoral scholar at the [University of California,
Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu).
Previously, I was at [TTIC](https://ttic.edu), after finishing my PhD in
Electrical Engineering at [Columbia University](https://ee.columbia.edu).

<!-- TODO: Rewrite/Rebrand! -->
I study the mathematics of representation learning from the
perspective of signals and data. I'm interested in questions that span theory
and practice &mdash; What structural properties of modern data underlie the
successes of deep learning? How can we scale our models more effectively by
exploiting this structure? Iâ€™m especially interested in transformers, and
applications to text and visual data.


## Recent Highlights

- **Book Release:** We have released version 1.0 of our new fully-open-source
  book on representation learning with deep networks
  [(link)](https://ma-lab-berkeley.github.io/deep-representation-learning-book/).
  It covers theoretical foundations from information theory to optimization as
  well as concrete applications such as transformers and contrastive learning.
  The book is full of new perspectives from our recent research---check out
  Chapters 3 and 6 for our take on diffusion, endorsed by the great [Kevin
  Murphy](https://x.com/sirbayes/status/1960358766270107807)!

## Upcoming Events

- **Tutorials:** I will be lecturing on topics from our new book at IAISS 2025
  in sunny Tuscany, Italy [(link)](https://2025.iaiss.cc/), and at ICCV 2025 in
  sunny Honolulu, Hawaii
  [(link)](https://iccv.thecvf.com/virtual/2025/tutorial/2852).


## Recent Updates

- **New Job:** I'm starting as a postdoc at UC Berkeley! _(Sep 2025)_

- **Preprint:** Two new preprints posted! One on a theoretical analysis of
  memorization and generalization in diffusion models [(link)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17689), and one on
  building diffusion models with proximal operators, leading to fewer NFEs at
  sampling time [(link)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08956).  _(Aug 2025)_

- **2nd Conference on Parsimony and Learning:** I co-organized the second
  [Conference on Parsimony and Learning (CPAL)](https://cpal.cc). Thanks to all
  attendees for making it a success! _(Mar 2025)_
