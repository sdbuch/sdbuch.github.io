### Short Bio

Sam Buchanan is a Research Assistant Professor at the Toyota Technological
Institute at Chicago (TTIC).
He obtained his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering
from Columbia University in 2022, advised by John Wright.
His research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning and
mathematical signal processing, and include the study of nonlinear
representation learning for high-dimensional data and its implications for the
design of deep architectures for solving applied problems in imaging and computer vision.
He received the 2017 NDSEG Fellowship, and the 2022 Eli Jury Award from
Columbia University in recognition of his PhD research.

### Old Seminar Materials

When I was starting the Ph.D. at Columbia in 2017, I led a student seminar on recent
neural network theory papers. [Here]( {{ site.baseurl }}/nn_seminar/) is the
link to the papers we discussed.
