- **ICLR 2024**: Presented two posters in Vienna: _Learned Proximal Networks_
  (Friday, May 10, a.m. session; [project
  page](https://zhenghanfang.github.io/learned-proximal-networks/), [ICLR
  page](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2024/poster/17978)) and _CRATE-MAE_ (Thursday,
  May 9, a.m. session; [project
  page](https://ma-lab-berkeley.github.io/CRATE/), [ICLR
  page](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2024/poster/18688)). _(May 2024)_

- **1st Conference on Parsimony and Learning:** I co-organized the inaugural [Conference on
  Parsimony and Learning (CPAL)](https://2024.cpal.cc), which took place at the
  University of Hong Kong from January 3--6, 2024. Thanks to all authors,
  speakers, organizers, and especially to the local team at HKU, whose hard
  work made the conference a success! Stay tuned for CPAL 2025. _(Jan 2024)_

- (December 2023) [New preprint posted](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14344) on
  methodology for data-driven inverse problem solvers with convergence
  guarantees. We presented this work at the [NeurIPS 2023 Learning-Based
  Solutions for Inverse Problems](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/79286)
  workshop.

- (June 2023) We taught a short course at ICASSP 2023 in Rhodes, Greece, titled
  ["Learning Nonlinear and Deep Low-Dimensional Representations from High-Dimensional Data: From Theory to Practice"](https://highdimdata-lowdimmodels-tutorial.github.io/).


- (January 2023) I co-organized the third [Workshop on Seeking
  Low-Dimensionality in Deep Neural Networks
  (SLowDNN)](https://slowdnn-workshop.github.io/). [Here is a link to my
  tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO39D_Jfq_E&t=3s&pp=ygUMc2FtIGJ1Y2hhbmFu).

- (September 2022) I defended my Ph.D. thesis (back in June!), and started as a
  Research Assistant Professor at TTIC. 

- (May 2022) I received the [Eli Jury
  Award](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/student-awards-and-fellowships) from the
  Columbia EE Department for "outstanding achievement in the area of signal
  processing". 

- (May 2022) We taught a short course at ICASSP 2022 in May, titled
  ["Low-Dimensional Models for High-Dimensional Data: From Linear to Nonlinear,
  Convex to Nonconvex, and Shallow to
  Deep"](https://highdimdata-lowdimmodels-tutorial.github.io/2022){:target="_blank"}{::comment}__{:/comment}.
  Slides are available!

- (April 2022) I attended the [Princeton ML Theory Summer
  School](https://mlschool.princeton.edu/) this summer from June 13--17. 

- (March 2022) [New preprint released]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/refine.pdf){:target="_blank"}{::comment}__{:/comment}
  on invariance-by-design neural architectures for computing with visual data,
  with theoretical guarantees.  Feedback is very much appreciated! 

- (December 2021) We presented our paper [Deep Networks Provably Classify Data
  on
  Curves](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2021/hash/f26df67e8110ee2b44923db775e3e47f-Abstract.html){:target="_blank"}{::comment}__{:/comment}
  at NeurIPS. 

- (August 2021) I gave a [talk about our work on the multiple manifold
  problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEaYY2TLvYY){:target="_blank"}{::comment}__{:/comment}
  at the IMA Workshop on Mathematical Foundation and Applications of Deep
  Learning at Purdue. Thanks to the organizers for the opportunity to speak!

- (July 2021) I will be attending the [Princeton Deep Learning Theory Summer
  School](https://deep-learning-summer-school.princeton.edu){:target="_blank"}{::comment}__{:/comment} this year.

- (May 2021) We will present our paper "Deep Networks and the Multiple Manifold
  Problem" at ICLR 2021 on Thursday, May 6th! Conference link
