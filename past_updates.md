- (September 2022) I defended my Ph.D. thesis (back in June!), and started as a
  Research Assistant Professor at TTIC. 

- (May 2022) I received the [Eli Jury
  Award](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/student-awards-and-fellowships) from the
  Columbia EE Department for "outstanding achievement in the area of signal
  processing". 

- (May 2022) We taught a short course at ICASSP 2022 in May, titled
  ["Low-Dimensional Models for High-Dimensional Data: From Linear to Nonlinear,
  Convex to Nonconvex, and Shallow to
  Deep"](https://highdimdata-lowdimmodels-tutorial.github.io/2022){:target="_blank"}{::comment}__{:/comment}.
  Slides are available!

- (April 2022) I attended the [Princeton ML Theory Summer
  School](https://mlschool.princeton.edu/) this summer from June 13--17. 

- (March 2022) [New preprint released]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/refine.pdf){:target="_blank"}{::comment}__{:/comment}
  on invariance-by-design neural architectures for computing with visual data,
  with theoretical guarantees.  Feedback is very much appreciated! 

- (December 2021) We presented our paper [Deep Networks Provably Classify Data
  on
  Curves](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2021/hash/f26df67e8110ee2b44923db775e3e47f-Abstract.html){:target="_blank"}{::comment}__{:/comment}
  at NeurIPS.

  problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEaYY2TLvYY){:target="_blank"}{::comment}__{:/comment}
  at the IMA Workshop on Mathematical Foundation and Applications of Deep
  Learning at Purdue. Thanks to the organizers for the opportunity to speak!
